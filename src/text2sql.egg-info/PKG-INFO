        # Text2SQL
        
        How many times have you pulled your hair apart writing a SQL query, now use natural language to convert to appropriate SQL and save your precious hair.
        
        Though this can be used as a standalone package, I highly recommend that you use `streamlit` to play with the model interactively, to run it interactively
        ```
        streamlit run t2s.py
        ```
